- 👋 Hi, I’m @shane-jeon, a coding bootcamp grad looking for that one special opportunity to help usher me into a new career as a programmer. 
  In my brief internship with Rocket Lawyer in the QA team, I proved to my team, manager, and most importantly myself that I am more than capable of 
  exceeding what is expected of a brand spanking new programmer. 
  
  In my past life, I was a healthcare referral specialist at a well-renown school in Cambridge, MA. Initially satisfied with my responsibilities, 
  two years of following mediocrity helped me realized how desperately I desired work that excites me and stimulates my intellect! Having a prior 
  existing interest in software engineering, I decided it was time to pursue a career where I could find the professional growth and development I craved. 

  It's been quite difficult challenge finding work in these uncertain economic times, but I remain committed to trust the process by dedicating my 9-5 
  weekdays to further my studies and hone my existing skillset through my personal projects.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Fullstack Development, though I am also inclined towards Backend, Frontend, or general web development.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... more about essential Computer Science fundamentals. On top of that, I am working to further reinforce the curriculum I 
  learned during my time at Hackbright Academy through my current project, 'Unititled DC Universe Project" (both title and project a work in progress!)
  Compared to my capstone project, I intend to incorporate the frameworks and languages I didn't have the time or understanding to include. I am committed
  to creating a web app that not only will truly display my honed skillsets and confidence in my knowledge, but to also develop a project that can be
  utilized by others (specifically other DC comic fans like myself).
  
- 💞️ Not currently looking for collaborations for the time being as I am fairly preoccupied with my job search,  studies, and my current project...
  but if you are interested in my Untitled DC Universe web app, I am more than happy to include collaborators to this pet project!
