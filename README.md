# Greetings üëã !

Hello world, I'm Shane, a developer with a passion for building ü§ñ and debugging üëæ. My journey into software engineering began with an internship in Quality Assurance, where I developed a strong foundation in testing and problem-solving. Since then, I‚Äôve expanded my skills through contract work with non-profit organizations and have focused primarily on Frontend Development.

I‚Äôm always looking for creative ways to grow my experience and skills‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs volunteering at tech conferences üé§, attending industry events üèôÔ∏è, or participating in Bay Area hackathons üí°. I‚Äôm excited to find my place in a specialized area of tech üíª where I can make a meaningful impact.
