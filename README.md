# Greetings ðŸ‘‹ !

Shane, a resourceful Freelance Frontend Engineer with experience working with non-profit organizations. I work primarily with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.

In Shane's free time, they like to network and discover creative ways to refine their existing skillset while learning new technologies. Shane is an active participant in Bay Area tech conferences, industry and networking events, and hackathons.

Their most recent participation in the 2024 San Francisco ETHGlobal Hackathon piqued an interest in Web3 and is redirecting their interest into the realm of blockchain technologies!
