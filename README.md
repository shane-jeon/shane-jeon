# Greetings 👋 !

Hello world, I'm Shane, a developer with a flair for building 🤖 and debugging 👾. My foray into the professional world of programming started with an internship in Quality Assurance. Since then, I've been exploring other avenues of software engineering through my contract work with non-profit organizations. Currently, most of my experience is in Frontend Development. 

I have a knack for discovering alternative means of building my experience and skillsets, such as attending/volunteering at tech conferences and participating in local Bay area 🌁 hackathons. I'm excited to find my home 🏠 in a niche field within tech 💻, which I am inclined to believe is in support engineering (having experience with customer service from a past professional lifetime).
