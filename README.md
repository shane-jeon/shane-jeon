# Greetings üëã !

Hello world, I'm Shane, a developer with a flair for building ü§ñ and debugging üëæ. My foray into the professional world of programming started with an internship in Quality Assurance. Since then, I've been exploring other avenues of software engineering through my contract work with non-profit organizations. Currently, most of my experience is in Frontend Development. 

I have a knack for discovering alternative means of building my experience and skillsets, such as attending/volunteering at tech conferences and participating in local Bay area üåÅ hackathons. I'm excited to find my home üè† in a niche field within tech üíª, which I am inclined to believe is in support engineering (having experience with customer service from a past professional lifetime).

I've built projects in the past with the following technologies:
